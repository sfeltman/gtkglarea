1. Help, ./configure does not find Mesa, I do have Mesa libaries installed.

    - Mesa may need additional libraries to link with, depending on what
      options were used while compiling Mesa libraries. Currently configure
      tries to link Mesa with whatever libraries GTK needs and if this fails
      it tries adding the pthreads libraries. Try passing extra libraries to
      ./configure in LIBS envinronment variable.



2. How do I make any widget opengl widget?

    Your widget needs an OpenGL capable visual.
    The widget must also have an X window (not all widgets have it).

    /* get visual using gdk_gl_choose_visual */
    visual = gdk_gl_choose_visual(visual_attributes);

    /* create your widget */
    widget = gtk_foobar_new();

    /* disable backing store (only in GTK-1.4) */
    gtk_widget_set_double_buffered(widget, FALSE);



3. How do I render to such widget?

    Create a GL context and connect it to the widget's GdkDrawable.

    context = gdk_gl_context(visual);

    /* connect to gdk window of widget */
    if (gdk_gl_make_current(widget->window, context)) {
        /* do opengl stuff... */

    }



6. Can I use gdk_gl functions and GtkGLArea widget in the same program?

    Yes, just remember that gtk_gl_area_make_current() makes the GtkGLArea
    widget's internal context the current context and leaves it so.



7. How do I capture keypress events for GtkGLArea widget?

    This is not a GtkGLArea specific question, but here is a solution:

    - Set an event mask:
         gtk_widget_set_events(glarea, GDK_KEY_PRESS_MASK);

    - Grab the focus:
        GTK_WIDGET_SET_FLAGS(glarea, GTK_CAN_FOCUS);
        gtk_widget_grab_focus(GTK_WIDGET(glarea));

    - Prevent possible default handlers from running:
        /* do this in the keypress handler and return TRUE from handler */
        g_signal_stop_emission_by_name (G_OBJECT(glarea), "key-press-event");
