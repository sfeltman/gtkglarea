Usage: viewlw [FILE]...

viewlw is a nifty little utility for viewing LightWave 3D objects.
Try viewing included alien.lwo and penguin.lwo objects.

In the program:
Mouse button 1 + drag           spin (virtual trackball)
Mouse button 2 + drag           zoom
Mouse button 3                  popup menu

and are freely useable, see files for more information.


zktor

Ingame keys:

cursor left             turn left
cursor right            turn right
cursor down             thrust
cursor up,space         fire
r                       restart
d                       detail
f                       switch between fullscreen/windowed mode (only with 3DFX)

Keyboard handling is buggy and needs to be fixed. For some reason key
releases are not received unless cursor is over glarea widget.
There is now rudimentary support for fullscreen 3DFX acceleration with
Mesa, but it is not compiled in as default. You have to uncomment
FULLSCREEN_MESA_3DFX defined near the start of zktor.c to compile it.
